This use case recreate the whole dataset, and then run SQL script to create a table, and stream data with no insertID

I've seen that in order to get data stream after dataset is recreated it requires some wait time before dataset is recreated to see subsequent data streamed visible.
(I was able to run it once 90 sec was enough for couple of runs, but later it needed much more),
After recreating dataset all, more or partial or no data is observed

Once I've seen more data I guess it could be due to internalError and retries
