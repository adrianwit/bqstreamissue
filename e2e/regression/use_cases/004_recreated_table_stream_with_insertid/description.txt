This use case recreate ont table (recreate=false) via SQL script, and stream data with insertID

I've seen that in order to get data stream after dataset is recreated it requires some wait time before dataset is recreated to see subsequent data streamed visible.
(I was able to run it once with 11 minutes wait to see subsequent data streamed sucessfully)

After recreating dataset all, partial or no data is observed
